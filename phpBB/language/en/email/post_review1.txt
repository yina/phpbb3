Subject: A personal invitation to help junior faculty.

{USERNAME},

Dr. Cronstein and I invite you to give feedback to a junior faculty member
for their proposed specific aims for an upcoming grant application.  You
received this email because a junior faculty member has identified you
as an expert in their interest area based on your publication record.

We greatly value your advice and input in this effort to enhance the grant
applications of our junior faculty.   It is more important now to provide
constructive criticism of junior faculty grants than it has ever been.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Dr. Bruce Cronstein
