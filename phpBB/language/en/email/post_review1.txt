Subject: An personal invitation to help junior faculty

Dr. {USERNAME},

Dr. Cronstein and I invite you to give feedback to a junior faculty member
for their proposed specific aims.

You have received this email because a
junior faculty member has selected you to provide feedback for your grant
because of expertise determined from your publication record.

NYU is piloting this feedback system to enhance grant quality.

The system gathers feedback from senior faculty with grant ideas and submissions.


Participation is completely optional. The system will record all interactions
and provides feedback to the administration, senior faculty, and junior faculty.

We record participation and quality of review
by senior faculty for reporting to the administration.
This participation will serve as a quantitative measure of teaching and feedback
for possible future promotion.

We record the senior faculty comments and junior faculty will rate the interaction
and provide feedback for the quality of the senior faculty's review.


At the link below, you will be given a questionnaire to determine whether you
may provide feedback for this grant proposal.

Please answer the corresponding questions in a follow up email.

You will be required to register on the prototype site. Responding will automatically
sign you up for the thread and notify you of comments as they are posted.


Thank you for your time and attention.

Dr. Bruce Cronstein
Dr. Yin Aphinyanaphongs
