Subject: An invitation to help junior faculty

Dr. {USERNAME},

NYU is piloting a feedback system to enhance the quality of specific aims.

The system gathers feedback from senior faculty with grant ideas and submissions.

You have received this email because a
junior faculty member has selected you to provide feedback for your grant
because of expertise determined from your publication record.

Participation is completely optional. The system will record all interactions
and provides feedback to the administration, senior faculty, and junior faculty.

We record participation and quality of review
by senior faculty for reporting to the administration.
This participation will serve as a quantitative measure of teaching and feedback
for possible future promotion.

We record the senior faculty comments and junior faculty will rate the interaction
and provide feedback for the quality of the senior faculty's review.


At the link below, you will be given a questionnaire to determine whether you
may provide feedback for this grant proposal.


Thank you for your time and attention.

Dr. Bruce Cronstein
